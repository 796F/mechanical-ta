4/11 Saturday

spent all day today reading and learning about existing image analysis
deciding on the langauge
thinking about how turks fit into this.  
decided on opencv, decided on python, based mostly on a single blog post.  
found problems with installing, had to compile opencv from source.  
    thank god for https://ceciliavision.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/installing-opencv-2-4-10-on-yosemite/,
    used that to compile, and then compile the python module,
    moved the module to site-packages and managed to import it.  

also used brew to install numpy and matplotlib

tried the basic example of loading an image from 
    https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_image_display/py_image_display.html#display-image

and that just made my day, seeing the image displayed was gratifying!
